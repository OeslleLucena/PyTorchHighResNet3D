# PyTorchHighResNet3D
PyTorch implementation of HighResNet3D from 
Li, Wenqi, et al. "On the compactness, efficiency, and representation of 3D convolutional networks: brain parcellation as a pretext task." International Conference on Information Processing in Medical Imaging. Springer, Cham, 2017.
based on current NiftyNet implementation (https://niftynet.readthedocs.io/en/dev/) and from 
github repository: "https://github.com/fepegar/pytorch-tests/blob/master/examples/segment/highresnet.py"
